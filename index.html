<body>
	<p>My name is Evelyn Myers. I go by Evie ("E-V") or Lyn, whichever you remember first!
	I am a 4th-year student in my second semester at IIT. I am studying IT and Cybersecurity.
	Currently, I am working full-time while also doing classes full-time. I have two dogs, Loki and Bailey.
	More into my computer side, I recently coded my own AI Chatbot in Java. I am planning, once I find time,
	to rewrite the program in Python.
